# why absorb?

- Task management tools are mostly web apps. **Why open a browser, sign up for a service and trust a company which stores your data?**
- **Have full control and flexibility of your data.** Upload your data to Github or backup it using your own preferred method. No lock-ins forever.
- Use the terminal to store your ideas, keep track of tasks, and much more! **No need to open up browsers and set up accounts.**
- absorb is built for the community. Want a feature to be added? Discuss about your ideas in discussions, and we'll try to implement it.
- Is your proposal is out of the scope of the project? Don't worry! You can build your own plugins easily!
-Experiment by creating your own plugins! **Break and build things. Install locally. Add your own dependencies. No need to wait for your PR to get merged.**

# FAQ

- **How do I create plugins?**
  - Check out [absorb-plugins](https://github.com/burntcarrot/absorb-plugins) for sample plugins and a guide on creating plugins from scratch!
- **Why can't I install `absorb` in Python 3.5/3.6?**
  - `absorb` uses [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for displaying content. [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) uses [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), which were introduced in Python 3.7 via [PEP 557](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/).
- **If I uninstall `absorb`, would my data get deleted too?**
  - **No.** absorb doesn't delete the files, so even if you messed up your installation or if you need to uninstall `pip`, you can re-install `absorb` and your data is loaded automatically.
- **How do I create backups?**
  - The "brain" (directory containing all files related to `absorb`) is a `git` repository. You can set up a cron job for uploading your files to GitHub, or even other cloud storage providers.
