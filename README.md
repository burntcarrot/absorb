# why absorb?

- Task management tools are mostly web apps. **Why open a browser, sign up for a service and trust a company which stores your data?**
- **Have full control and flexibility of your data.** Upload your data to Github or backup it using your own preferred method. No lock-ins forever.
- Use the terminal to store your ideas, keep track of tasks, and much more! **No need to open up browsers and set up accounts.**
- absorb is built for the community. Want a feature to be added? Discuss about your ideas in discussions, and we'll try to implement it.
- Is your proposal is out of the scope of the project? Don't worry! You can build your own plugins easily!
-Experiment by creating your own plugins! **Break and build things. Install locally. Add your own dependencies. No need to wait for your PR to get merged.**
